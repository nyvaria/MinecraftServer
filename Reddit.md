Nyvaria is a family friendly, community based survival multiplayer server. It was created in January 2009 by captbunzo. Originally, Nyvaria was created as a place for the captain's kids to play. However, soon the server evolved into much more. Today we have players of all ages and many additional server features.

This includes both a creative and skyblock world. Access to the creative world is granted to players based on their demonstration of building capability. Also, while we do have these worlds and may add some other games in the future, the server is (and will always be) first and foremost survival focused.

As the server was founded with family friendliness in mind, players should be aware that language and content must be kept clean and suitable for players of all ages. Also, we make a priority of keeping the game fun for everyone. Part of that is not having to deal with constant grief and thievery. As such, we use plugins including as Prism and Residence that allows players stuff to be protected.

Please join us today. We look forward to seeing you there!

Cheers,
