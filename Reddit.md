Nyvaria is a family friendly, survival multiplayer community. Created in January 2012 by captbunzo as a place for his kids to play some Minecraft, Nyvaria soon evolved into much more. Today we have players of all ages and many additional server features.

This includes a collection of custom plugins and commands as well as both a skyblock and creative world.

On agreeing to the server rules, Guests are granted Residency in Nyvaria. Residents can build in all survival worlds and can play in skyblock. Residents can apply for Citizenship by creating and presenting an impressive suvival build. Citizenship applications are reviewed by one staff member and one existing Citizen. As a Citizen, a player can build in the creative world and are allowed to create shops in survival.

While we do have the skyblock and creative worlds and may add some other games in the future, the server is (and will always be) first and foremost survival focused.

As the server was founded with family friendliness in mind, players should be aware that language and content must be kept clean and suitable for players of all ages. Also, we make a priority of keeping the game fun for everyone. Part of that is not having to deal with constant grief and thievery. As such, we use plugins including as Prism, LWC and Residence that allows players to protect their stuff and griefers to be dealt with.

Please join us today. We look forward to seeing you there!

Cheers,
