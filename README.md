Minecraft Server
================

This github project is for tracking of issues relating to the general operation, enhancement and maintenance of the Nyvaria Minecraft server. I might also eventually upload some of the code (start script, housekeeping, etc).

You can [browse existing issues](https://github.com/nyvaria/MinecraftServer/issues) or [create a new issue](https://github.com/nyvaria/MinecraftServer/issues/new). However, please first check if the issue has already been reported.
